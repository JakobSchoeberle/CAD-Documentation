## Prerequisites

* An email

* Student ID

## Step 1 - Creating an Autodesk Account 

 1. Go to [Autodesk Account Settings](https://manage.autodesk.com/home/)

 2. Click create account(if you don’t see create account, click sign in in the upper
right hand of the screen and then click create account)
 
 3. Fill out form boxes(use your real name, this is the name that will appear in vault.
Also use an at least semi-professional email address). Click Create account.

 4. You will be sent a verification email. Click verify, in the email.

## Step 2 - Setting up an Autodesk Account

 1. Go to https://www.autodesk.com/education/competitions/first

 2. Scroll down to the section labeled “Free software for FIRST” click on “Get
Inventor”

 3. Click the black “Get started” button(it may have you log in again)

 4. You should now be on the “Set up your education profile” screen. Fill out all the
form boxes and keep hitting next once filled out. Once you see the green checkmark, your
account is still not fully set up, it’s a bamboozle.

 5. Once again go to https://www.autodesk.com/education/competitions/first click “Get
inventor” again.

 6. Click any of the “Get started” buttons. It will have you upload proof of being a student(or
if you’re a mentor do your mentor stuff). It may take a while to verify but once that’s done your
account should be all set up!(finally, geez why is this so hard) If you’re waiting for your account
verification, you can go to step 3 and set up the VPN while you wait.
